Demo code of MetaRank, a Semantics-based Prediction Model for up- and coming NFTs
Pseudo Code created via AI from a prompt generated by Solana IDE's Anchor Model.

> This is only for conceptual understanding of a tool that can be used on and with Solana's ecosystem, and is not a functional tool. The code is purposesly generated solely using AI to illustrate the potentials of Solana's IDE for Anchoring. Please do not try to compile this code.

## Introduction to the Program Functionalities
</summary>

Here's a structured approach to organizing this Solana program using the Anchor framework, TypeScript SDK, and test cases. 

*Solana Program Structure (Anchor Framework)*

We will break down the program into several components:

- State (Accounts): Store data for NFTs.
- Instructions: Each instruction for manipulating or predicting NFT behavior (like analyse_data, knn_peers, etc.) will be in its own file.
- Tests: TypeScript-based tests for each instruction.
- SDK: A TypeScript SDK to interact with the Anchor program.

Conclusion
With this structure:

Accounts are defined in state.rs.

Instructions are modularized in separate files within the instructions folder.

Tests are organized into TypeScript files in the tests folder.

SDK code provides functions to interact with the Solana program from TypeScript.
